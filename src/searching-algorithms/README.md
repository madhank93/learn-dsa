### What is a Searching Algorithm ?

Searching Algorithms are designed to check or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored.

Based on the type of search operation, these algorithms are generally classified into two categories.

- **Sequential search:**
  The list or array of elements is traversed sequentially while checking every component of the set. **Example** - Linear Search.

- **Interval search:**
  The interval search includes algorithms that are explicitly designed for searching in sorted data structures. In terms of efficiency, these algorithms are far better than linear search algorithms. **Example** - Binary search, Ternary Search.
